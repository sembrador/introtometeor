introtometeor
==============

Inspired by https://github.com/phillc/meteor-impress

A simple introduction to Meteor presentation that supports anonymous viewers and Meter accounts package users.  If admin is logged in all viewers both anonymous and logged in users are led through the presentation by the admin.

This is a quick hack and does not implement all the necessary Meteor security features.

Meteor
=============

Meteor is an ultra-simple environment for building modern web applications.

With Meteor you write apps:

* in pure Javascript
* that send data over the wire, rather than HTML
* using your choice of popular open-source libraries

Documentation is available at http://docs.meteor.com/


impress.js
============

https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/

It's a presentation framework based on the power of CSS3 transforms and 
transitions in modern browsers and inspired by the idea behind prezi.com.
